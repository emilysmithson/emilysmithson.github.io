<h1>Les Petits Zouzous</h1>
<p>This app was written in collaboration with the Alliance Francaise of Bristol
  <p>It is designed to teach young children French vocabularly through song.
    <p>It uses animations and music. 
  <p>Note that music is not yet supported in Flutter web so this app does not work properly here but is available free from both app stores.</p>
