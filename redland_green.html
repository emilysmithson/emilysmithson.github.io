<h1>Redland Green Tree Trail</h1>
<p>This app combines my love of my local green space with my love of Flutter. 
  <p>It takes you on a stroll around the stunning Redland Green and teaches you about the trees found there.
  <p>It includes an interacive map created with Leaflet.</p>
<p>All photos were taken on my iPhone during my one daily exercise during lockdown.</p>
