  Mesmerising Clock
  </h1>
  <p>
    This clock was originally designed as part of the Flutter Clock Challenge. 
    The arcs move in time with the minute and second hands.
    If you tap on the screen it brings up settings options so that you can select the colours that you want.
    <p>
    This app was built using flutter. It features animations which move in time. It has a backend SQLite server which keeps track of the users options. </p>
