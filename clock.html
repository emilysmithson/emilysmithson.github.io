    This clock was originally designed as part of the Flutter Clock Challenge. 
    It features four sets of 8 arcs. One set moves clockwise in time with the second hand whilst the second moves anticlockwise at the same speed. 
    The third group move clockwise in time with the minute hand and the final group moves anticlockwise in time with the minute hand. 
    If you tap on the screen it brings up settings options so that you can select the colours that you want.

    This app was built using flutter. It features animations which move in time. It has a backend SQLite server which keeps track of the users options.
