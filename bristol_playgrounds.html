<h1>Bristol Playgrounds</h1>
<p>This app is part game and part guide. It features all the very best plagyrounds in the Bristol area.
  <p>There is an interactive map and a filterable list to help you select a playground to visit. 
  <p>Every time you visit a playground you win a piece of playground equipment to go in your very own virtual playground.</p>
<p>It uses Flare animations and the interactive map is created using Leaflet.
  <p>The character design was done by my 11 year old daughter.
  <p>Please note that the web version does not have full functionality. </p>
